# Game Objective

In Bards 'n’ Mead, your humble tavern is your kingdom, and Renown is the key to victory. Over the course of 8 raucous rounds, you'll roll dice, hire legendary Bards, pour frothy flagons of Mead, and sabotage your rivals, all to become the most celebrated tavern keeper in the land.

The player with the most Renown at the end of the final round wins the game. Renown is earned by dazzling crowds with Bard performances, serving Mead to thirsty patrons, and disrupting your opponents’ plans with crafty Sabotage.

Each player also begins the game with a Secret Goal, a hidden objective that, if achieved by game’s end, awards bonus Renown.
